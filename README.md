## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned quite a lot during this project, aspects of JavaScript that I wasn't comfortable with just a week ago kinda clicked into place for this one. Granted it isn't much in terms of functional, but now that I know I can do it I feel a lot more confident moving forward to more challenging projects!

### Continued development

I still find JavaScript the biggest hurdle for where I want to go, but in this project it felt surprisingly comfortable so I think it's a step in the right direction.

I would like to challenge myself more when it comes to JavaScript so I'm thinking I might start taking on some of the level 2 or 3 challeneges from Frontend Mentor soon and see exactly where I fit in with my skill level right now. I don't want to get over confident and ruin my self esteem, but I would like to make something more functional.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Honestly for this project I only really used google when I got stuck, I wanted to make sure that I was finding the information I needed without watching video tutorials.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - 90% of the JavaScript knowledge I was lacking on this project came from here. Which helped me get a better understanding of what I'm doing, even though I really don't know what I'm doing most of the time.
